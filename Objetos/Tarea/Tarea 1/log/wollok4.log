Movistar y Claro cobran $0,12 centavos el mensaje, y Personal $0,15.\nHacer que una persona cualquiera le mande un mensaje a otra.\nSaber cuántos mensajes le llegaron a una persona.\nSaber si una persona recibió un cierto mensaje, o sea, un mensaje con un determinado texto.\nSaber si una persona recibió un mensaje que empiece con un determinado texto, por ejemplo, con \"Esta noche\".\nSaber cuánta plata gastó una persona luego de hacer varias llamadas y envíos de mensajes.\n\nTodo lo que viene abajo, debería hacerse en un solo objeto, y que ande para todas las personas. Está relacionado con lo que preguntamos en el punto a. de este ejercicio.\nEjercicio 9\nIndicar qué objetos aparecen y cómo colaboran para resolver los siguientes problemas:\nUn estudiante desea anotarse en las materias de este cuatrimestre. Para esto necesita: saber qué cursos hay de cada materia y sus profesores, controlar no anotarse en dos materias a la misma hora, controlar que tiene las correlativas.\nb. Un zorro busca alimento en un gallinero donde hay gallinas, patos, gallos y huevos; donde cada posible comida tiene una energía, un sabor y un grado de peligrosidad.\nObservar:\n¿Qué objetos intervienen? No limitarse necesariamente a los objetos físicos. En particular, si aparece la necesidad de objetos que representen conjuntos, pensar qué mensajes deberían entender.\n¿Cómo se envían los mensajes? ¿Qué argumentos?\nEjercicio 10\njuan.peso()\nsillaDeLaCocina.peso()\nEstos dos objetos ¿son polimórficos?\nAyuda: pensar en el \"tercer objeto\" de la definición de polimorfismo.\nEjercicio 11\nUna biblioteca tiene sus libros clasificados en informática, filosofía, matemáticas, derecho y\neconomía.\nDesea poder preguntarle a los objetos que representan libros por cuánto tiempo los pueden prestar. Los libros de informática y filosofía se prestan por dos semanas, los de matemática por 1 semana si tienen 1 capítulo y por 3 semanas si tienen dos o más capítulos; cualquier otro libro se presta por 5 semanas.\nRealizar y codificar una solución a este problema.\n*/"},"name":"comment"}],"name":"example","problems":[{"code":"malformedEntity","sourceMap":{"end":{"column":0,"line":226,"offset":7501},"start":{"column":1,"line":194,"offset":5946}}}],"scope":{"containerScope":{"contributions":{},"includedScopes":[]},"contributions":{},"includedScopes":[]}},"stack":"Error: Failed to print, found malformed node\n    at /home/bran/.vscode/extensions/uqbar.wollok-lsp-ide-0.3.5/out/server/src/server.js:68:3533\n    at iln (/home/bran/.vscode/extensions/uqbar.wollok-lsp-ide-0.3.5/out/server/src/server.js:68:3344)\n    at /home/bran/.vscode/extensions/uqbar.wollok-lsp-ide-0.3.5/out/server/src/server.js:2275:847\n    at /home/bran/.vscode/extensions/uqbar.wollok-lsp-ide-0.3.5/out/server/src/server.js:2288:3774\n    at /home/bran/.vscode/extensions/uqbar.wollok-lsp-ide-0.3.5/out/server/src/server.js:37:74770\n    at Fe (/home/bran/.vscode/extensions/uqbar.wollok-lsp-ide-0.3.5/out/server/src/server.js:7:8527)\n    at Pt (/home/bran/.vscode/extensions/uqbar.wollok-lsp-ide-0.3.5/out/server/src/server.js:7:6189)\n    at Gi (/home/bran/.vscode/extensions/uqbar.wollok-lsp-ide-0.3.5/out/server/src/server.js:7:6378)\n    at Immediate._onImmediate (/home/bran/.vscode/extensions/uqbar.wollok-lsp-ide-0.3.5/out/server/src/server.js:7:6142)\n    at process.processImmediate (node:internal/timers:478:21)","timestamp":"2024-09-25T21:28:52.518Z"}

tom es manejar su energía y su velocidad, que dependen de sus actividades de comer ratones\ny de correr. \nLa persona que registra las actividades de tom, registra los ratones que come y la cantidad de tiempo que corre \nen segundos. \nCuando tom come un ratón, su energía aumenta en (12 joules + el peso del ratón en gramos). La \nvelocidad de tom es 5 metros x segundo + (energia medida en joules / 10). \nCuando tom corre, su energía disminuye en (0.5 x cantidad de metros que corrió).
